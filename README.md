# AVSTP

AVSTP - Avisynth Thread Pool

AVSTP is a programming library for Avisynth plug-in developers.
It helps supporting native multi-threading in plug-ins.
It works by sharing a thread pool between multiple plug-ins, so the 
number of threads stays low whatever the number of instantiated 
plug-ins.

A single avstp.dll can serve multiple avstp-aware Avisynth plugin dlls
when is copied next to them.
Such plugins can use or not use the services of avstp.
