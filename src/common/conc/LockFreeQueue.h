        LockFreeQueue.h
        Author: Laurent de Soras, 2011

The object is placed in a cell which is sent to the queue. The cell is NOT
copied during the process of enqueue/dequeue and therefore is not kept by the
queue. Only its link is changed.

It is to the user's responsibility to handle the cell memory and to keep it
safe until the cell is dequeued.

Template parameters:

- T: type of the contained object.
