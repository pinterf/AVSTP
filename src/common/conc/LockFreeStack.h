        LockFreeStack.h
        Author: Laurent de Soras, 2011

The object is placed in a cell which is sent to the stack. The cell is NOT
copied during the process of push/pop and therefore is not kept by the stack.
Only its link is changed.

It is to the user's responsibility to handle the cell memory and to keep it
safe until the cell is popped.

It has also to keep the cell's memory location valid until ALL the reading
clients terminate their operations, because the pop() operation may be reading
the next pointer of a cell which as been already popped by another reader.

Template parameters:

- T: type of the contained objects.
